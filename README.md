🚀 Technical Overview
As a software engineer, I built this platform to explore the intersection of 3D rendering and responsive web design. The project focuses on high-performance visuals and smooth user interactions.

Key Features
3D Interactive Hero: Leveraged Three.js to create engaging 3D elements that react to user input.

Utility-First Design: Implemented Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive, modern UI that maintains performance across all device types.

Modular Architecture: Organized with clean ES6+ JavaScript to ensure scalability as features are added.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3

Graphics: Three.js (WebGL)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend (In-Progress): Python integration for appointment scheduling and customer data persistence.
